abstract: |
    This note describes a Markdown document preparation system for IVOA standards and notes.
    This system makes use of classes and templates defined in the \ivoatex
    project and will support the production of PDF and HTML renderings of the
    documents with sources in plain text suitable for version control, as is
    desirable for normative texts.
